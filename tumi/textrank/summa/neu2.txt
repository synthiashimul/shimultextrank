monday, the same day it announced the death of leader kim jong il, south korea's yonhap news agency reported. two south korean military officials said they couldn't immediately confirm the report, saying to do so would breach a policy of not commenting on intelligence matters. both said any firing would be part of a routine drill and have little relation to kim jong il's death. they both spoke on condition of anonymity, citing policy. yonhap cited unidentified government and military officials as saying the test occurred off the east coast. south korea has put its military on high alert against the north's 1.2 million-strong armed forces. president barack obama agreed by phone with south korean president lee myung-bak to closely monitor developments. north korea is preparing for next

delete your tweet location history. unity. thats the name of the detergent that roger goodell, the owners, and the most desperate stooges in the media are going to use to scrub this trump vs. sports mess until all thats left is a shiny, useless bauble. were already well on our way. kaepernick has put his time and his money behind causes that seek to make this country a better one for the oppressed. the same is true of other players who have demonstrated before games. these are actions taken in pursuit of concrete solutions to real problems, and theyre what every pre-game act of protest is meant to draw attention to. but where does the attention lie now? for as much as the events of the past weekend were framed as trump going to war with the nfl, our bum of a president did roger goodell and the league a huge favor. all they had to do was release a few limp-dick statements tsk-tsking trumps comments for their divisiveness, come up with a few meaningless shows of pseudo-solidarity like we saw in arizona last night, and poof: suddenly the anthem protests arent about a very specific set of problems plaguing this country, but about unity, a cause more hollow than anything 25 branding execs could ever dream up in a conference room. roger goodell is on the cover of sports illustrated. colin kaepernick isnt. kaepernicks protest and the ones that followed were divisive, and were meant to be: that was the point, to ask people to choose sides, and to direct their attention to whats going on in the real world beyond sports. goodell and the owners, in asking everyone to come together around the cause of the nfl itself, have done what they always do, and made what theyve touched cheaper and smaller. its been weeks since a coalition of nfl players sent a memo pleading with goodell to offer real, tangible support for their activism. included in that memo was a specific list of activities that goodell could take part in in order to help them achieve their goals of bail reform, increased police transparency, and passage of clean slate legislation. who knows if goodell has done any of the things he was asked to do in that memo, or if he ever planned on working with the players at all. whats clear now, though, is that he doesnt have to if he doesnt want to. advertisement all he has to do now is remain united with his players in favor of the nfl and good things like vague civic virtues, and against bad ones like any actual discussion of how to make good on the promises those virtues offer.focused crawls are collections of
